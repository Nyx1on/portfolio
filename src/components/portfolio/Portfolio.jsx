        <p>
          Hello! My name is Nirnay, and I am a software developer with expertise
          in React, Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB. I also have experience as a
          blockchain engineer, working with Ethereum to build decentralized
          applications and smart contracts. I have built a variety of full-stack
          web applications and my ability to work with both front-end and
          back-end technologies has enabled me to build complete and robust
          applications that meet the needs of users.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my technical skills, I am also an active open source
          contributor. I believe in the power of collaboration and have
          contributed my knowledge and code to various open source projects.
          This experience has helped me develop a deep understanding of the
          development process and has allowed me to learn from other skilled
          developers in the community. Overall, I am passionate about building
          innovative software that solves real-world problems and improves
          people's lives. If you are looking for a software developer who can
          build high-quality applications with attention to detail and a
          commitment to excellence, then I would love to work with you.
